                </ul>
                If you aren't sure if a behavior is acceptable, ask yourself "Does this build up and encourage someone? Is this appropriate in a professional setting?" If you still aren't sure, <a href="/organizers/">please ask an organizer</a>.</p>
            </li>
            <li><h3>What to Do When an Incident Occurs</h3><ul>

                <li>If you are asked to stop a violating behavior, you are expected to comply immediately, even if you do not believe the behavior violates this Code of Conduct.
